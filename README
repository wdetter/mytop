ABOUT

  mytop is a `top' clone for MySQL

  mytop is a console-based (non-gui) tool for monitoring the threads
  and overall performance of MySQL 3.22.x, 3.23.x, 4.x and 5.x servers.
  It runs on most Unix systems which have Perl, DBI, and Term::ReadKey
  installed. And with Term::ANSIColor installed you even get color. As
  of version 0.7, it even runs on Windows (somewhat).

  This release is based on release 1.6 and updated to 1.8 (Jeremy did
  a bug releae of 1.7 so I've jumped to 1.8)

  I (Mark Grennan) have continued to inprove mytop for people who use
  mostly MyISAM databases.  If you use InnoDB databases you should loook
  at using innotop.

INSTALLATION

  tar -zxvf mytop-<version>.tar.gz
  cd mytop-<version>

  The test is a bit stupid, but it's there from completeness.
